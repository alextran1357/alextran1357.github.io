I am a quality-focused professional with full-stack software engineering, website performance optimization, and e-commerce solution development experience. Recognized for demonstrating a natural aptitude for enhancing UX by ensuring optimal solution efficiency and performance, as well as for guiding end-to-end software development lifecycles (SDLC) and producing scalable and well-structured code, I have a verifiable history of contributing directly to success throughout my career. As such, I have consistently exceeded performance goals and I am adept at collaborating with cross-functional teams. Professional focal points include backend system development, ETL pipeline development, team collaboration, artificial intelligence (AI), feature development, programming, team leadership, UX optimization, code reviews, and Agile/Scrum. Delivering superior administration on the latter areas of expertise requires utilization of effective communication skills, analytical skills, as well as technical acumen, issue resolution, project management, and change management to support efficiency and quality. 

Currently, I serve as a Volunteer Shopify Developer with Radical where I have led application development and customization initiatives. Prior to this, as a Coding AI Trainer with Outlier, I conducted in-depth code reviews to verify the quality and integrity of AI-generated code. As a Software Engineer with Ezoic, I led key application development and data pipeline optimization initiatives, resulting in $10,000+ in monthly cost savings and an 80% reduction in contractor dependencies.

Colleagues describe me as a progressive, driven, down-to-earth, technical and analytical expert who can be relied on to offer superior solutions that deliver high-quality results.
